## Running nix-shell

To get your dev environment setup all you need to do is to run `nix-shell`

## Installing packages

When running ``npm install``, don't worry about warnings or skipped optional dependencies. 

```
npm install
bash ./setup.sh
npm run build
```

## Set up crypto wallets

The camera scanner mock reads the wallet addresses from your device_config.json file.You need to add a property under brain.mockCryptoQR where the key is the cryptoCode and the value is the address to be returned by the mocked camera.

Example:

```
{
  "brain": {
    ...
    "mockCryptoQR": {
      "BTC": "XXXXXXX"
    }
  },
  ...
```

## Run and pair

First, make sure lamassu-server is properly installed, configured, and running. See the ``INSTALL.md`` file in lamassu-server. Then, run lamassu-machine:

In first terminal window, run the bill validator simulator:

```
node bin/fake-bills.js
```

In second terminal window:

```
node bin/lamassu-machine --mockBillValidator --mockBillDispenser --mockCam \
--devBoard --mockPair '<totem-from-admin>'
```

**IMPORTANT**: Make sure to use single quotes and not double quotes, or the shell will mess up the totem.

Click on ``Init``, then ``Scan``. You should see the start screen.

For subsequent runs, you don't need the ``--mockPair`` flag.

## Open in browser

In firefox or chrome, open the ``ui/start.html`` file. The URL should be something like this:

```
file://<lamassu-machine-dir>/ui/start.html?debug=dev
```

Don't worry if the fonts don't look right. The production software uses a proprietary font. Click on ``INIT`` (it should be fast on your computer), then ``SCAN``. After a few moments of pairing, you should see the start screen.

When the screen asks you to insert a bill, navigate to the terminal
where you opened the mock bill validator, and input **1**<kbd>Enter</kbd>
to insert a one dollar bill.

## If you're having trouble with tiny-secp256k1 installation related to node-gyp 

Sometimes it might be a [locale-related issue](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/32848)

Try executing the `npm install` step inside a `--pure` flagged `nix-shell`

```
nix-shell --pure
[nix-shell:<lamassu-machine-dir>]$ npm install
```

## If you're having trouble with ENOENT: node_modules/node-sass/vendor 

```
npm rebuild node-sass
```

## If you're having trouble with serialport bindings

Configure mockPrinter on your device_config.json
```
{
  "brain": {
    ...
    "mockPrinter": true,
  },
  ...
```
